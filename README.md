This project uses health-related metrics to predict whether a patient has heart disease. 
--trained and compared multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM to find the best-performing classifier

## Problem Statement
Predict the presence of heart disease using: 
- Age, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose
- Lifestyle factors: smoking, alcohol, physical activity
- Gender, height, weight

## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning (Dropped ID/Date)
- Feature Scaling + One-Hot Encoding
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM
- Model comparison and evaluation

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Prescision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Key Takeaways
- Logistic Regression  had the most balanced performance
- KNN and SVM struggled due to high dimensionality
- Decision Tree slightly overfit the data

## Dataset
Health checkup dataset with 10+ lifestyle and clinical variables.
